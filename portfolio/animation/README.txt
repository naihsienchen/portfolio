=== MY WORK SECTION ANIMATION ===
source: https://tympanus.net/codrops/2011/11/02/original-hover-effects-with-css3/

In this section, I used to flexbox to align the image containers, and the source code uses float containers. When I started to style the animation, I couldn't position the "masks" precisly as intended. I had to change back to the original codes and edited them given the time limit, so the code might look very similar to the original code. I am really sorry about this, and will redo it over the break for practicing's sake.

=== ANIME-TEST HTML AND CSS ===
I was intended to use stroke/write-out effect to create animation, and spent most of my time investigation how to create an svg file with fonts and its relating path. I ended up using inkscape to convert text to svg, and editing the source code to animate the stroke. I wasn't able to spare enough time to put it nicely with my page, so I submitted them separately.

THANK YOU FOR A GREAT SEMESTER AND HAVE A NICE HOLIDAY!
